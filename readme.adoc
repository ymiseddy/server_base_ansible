= Base Ansible Server Setup

Installs base apt packages that are common to all infrastructure
servers.

== To Use
Rename inventory.config to inventory.  If you are not using an ed2519
key for ssh, then edit the ansible.cfg and populate this with your
key.   

Up front - you will need to create your base user on all servers and
ensure your public key is on all of them.

TODO: Need to make the base user configurable.
